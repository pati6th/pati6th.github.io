				PaTI and Fikra have come together and started this collaboration thanks to the kind invitation and connection from the Ministry of Culture and Youth in the UAE, as part of the UAE and Korea Cultural Dialogue initiative 2020. The engagement between PaTI and Fikra is framed around an online educational experiment and around a cultural exchange which will potentially expand into future collaborations and initiatives. The final outcome of the experiment is two-fold: firstly to present the participant’s work and share the experience of a new relationship built across design mediums, and secondly to discuss how such dialogue between PaTI and Fikra has unfolded and shed light on the commonalities and differences related to design practice and culture.

				For this workshop, 12 students are selected to participate and exchange culture and local cuisines: 6 from South Korea and 6 from the United Arab Emirates. 
				Students are invited to bring and introduce their favorite national dish to the whole group on the launch day. A random selection of the 12 specialties presented was taken place in order to assign one of these to each participant.

				The goal of the workshop is to bridge cultures through the process of design that involves searching, researching, and learning.
				This also provides an opportunity for absorbing the other’s cultural culinary identity through a new pair of eyes – resulting in unexpected and experimental interpretations.

				The students presented their individual final outcomes which could potentially be extended into a variety of forms in the future, such as an exhibition, publication or other workshops.

				Lucky Bag for 3 Dates 대추야자 3개를 위한 복주머니

				The important number 3 in Islam, Dates and Date palm tree; the lifeline of middle east, and Korean Bok-jumoni, the tiny bag that brings good luck and relesing bad energy are combine to one for sharing love, good luck, power, triumph, abundance and faith with people during the Ramadan period.</p>
